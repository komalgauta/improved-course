## Alert Detail



### [ SQL Injection ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40018/)



##### High (Medium)

### Description

SQL injection may be possible.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: `ZAP OR 1=1 -- `
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `The page results were successfully manipulated using the boolean conditions [ZAP AND 1=1 -- ] and [ZAP OR 1=1 -- ]
The parameter value being modified was NOT stripped from the HTML output for the purposes of the comparison
Data was NOT returned for the original parameter.
The vulnerability was detected by successfully retrieving more data than originally returned, by manipulating the parameter`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.
In general, type check all data on the server side.
If the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'
If the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.
If database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.
Do *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality!
Do not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.
Escape all data received from the client.
Apply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.
Apply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.
In particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.
Grant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.

### [ Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10202/)



##### Medium (Low)

### Description

No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form.
A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.

CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:
    * The victim has an active session on the target site.
    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.
    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site.

CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered to disclose information by gaining access to the response. The risk of information disclosure is dramatically increased when the target site is vulnerable to XSS, because XSS can be used as a platform for CSRF, allowing the attack to operate within the bounds of the same-origin policy.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `<form action="/" method="POST">`
  * Other Info: `No known Anti-CSRF token [anticsrf, CSRFToken, __RequestVerificationToken, csrfmiddlewaretoken, authenticity_token, OWASP_CSRFTOKEN, anoncsrf, csrf_token, _csrf, _csrfSecret, __csrf_magic, CSRF, _token, _csrf_token] was found in the following HTML form: [Form 1: "age" "consent" "email" "password" "pseudonym" "username" ].`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Phase: Architecture and Design
Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.
For example, use anti-CSRF packages such as the OWASP CSRFGuard.

Phase: Implementation
Ensure that your application is free of cross-site scripting issues, because most CSRF defenses can be bypassed using attacker-controlled script.

Phase: Architecture and Design
Generate a unique nonce for each form, place the nonce into the form, and verify the nonce upon receipt of the form. Be sure that the nonce is not predictable (CWE-330).
Note that this can be bypassed using XSS.

Identify especially dangerous operations. When the user performs a dangerous operation, send a separate confirmation request to ensure that the user intended to perform that operation.
Note that this can be bypassed using XSS.

Use the ESAPI Session Management control.
This control includes a component for CSRF.

Do not use the GET method for any request that triggers a state change.

Phase: Implementation
Check the HTTP Referer header to see if the request originated from an expected page. This could break legitimate functionality, because users or proxies may have disabled sending the Referer for privacy reasons.

### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined: 
form-action

The directive(s): form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### CWE Id: [ 693 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)


#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Application Error Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90022/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

This page contains an error/warning message that may disclose sensitive information like the location of the file that produced the unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch further attacks against the web application. The alert could be a false positive if the error message is found inside a documentation page.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Review the source code of this page. Implement custom error pages. Consider implementing a mechanism to provide a unique error reference/identifier to the client (browser) while logging the details on the server side and not exposing them to the user.

#### WASC Id: 13

#### Source ID: 3

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `email`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=email
userValue=zaproxy@example.com
passwordParam=password
referer=http://localhost:8000`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.
